# 4chan-downloader-desu

A simple script to scrape images and webms from 4chan.org threads. No bs, just paste thread url and start downloading. Only available on linux, comment if you want me to port it to windows or add a feature(like preserve original filename, download only specific file types etc).

You will be prompted to input thread url and create a folder in $HOME/Downloads, which is the default save path.

## DEPENDENCIES:
This script needs following python libraries to function:

[**beautifulsoup4**](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) - install with `$ sudo pip install beautifulsoup4`
